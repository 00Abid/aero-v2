      "title": "What is HR Coil? (Hot Rolled Coil Full Form)",
      "content": "HR coil stands for Hot Rolled Coil. Hot rolled coils are steel coils manufactured by heating steel slabs above their recrystallization temperature (typically over 1700°F or 927°C) and passing them through a series of rollers while still hot. This hot-rolling process prevents work hardening, making the steel easier to form, bend, and weld. HR coils have a characteristic mill scale finish and slightly rounded edges. They are more cost-effective than cold rolled (CR) coils and are preferred for applications where surface finish is less critical but strength and weldability are essential."

      "content": "GI coil stands for Galvanized Iron Coil. Galvanized iron coils are steel coils coated with a layer of zinc through the hot-dip galvanization process. The zinc coating provides excellent corrosion resistance, protecting the underlying steel from rust and oxidation. GI coils are manufactured by passing cold rolled or hot rolled steel through a molten zinc bath at approximately 450°C, resulting in a metallurgical bond between zinc and steel. The zinc coating thickness ranges from 80 GSM to 275 GSM depending on application requirements. GI coils are the most widely used coated steel product in construction, roofing, automotive, and HVAC industries."

    "title": "What is CR Sheet 8x4 ft?",
    "content": "CR sheet (Cold Rolled Sheet) is steel sheet manufactured by cold-rolling process at room temperature, resulting in smooth surface finish, uniform thickness, and improved mechanical properties. The standard 8x4 ft (2440mm x 1220mm) size is the most common industrial sheet dimension in India. Unlike hot rolled sheets with rough mill scale, CR sheets have no scale, bright smooth surface, and tighter tolerances (+/-0.05mm vs +/-0.5mm for HR). Cold rolling process work-hardens the steel, increasing strength while maintaining formability. CR sheets are preferred for automotive body panels, home appliances, furniture, and applications where surface finish, dimensional accuracy, and aesthetic appearance matter."

The standard 8x4 ft (2440mm x 1220mm) size is the most common industrial sheet dimension in India, widely used in roofing, construction, and fabrication industries. The zinc coating protects the underlying steel from rust and oxidation, offering 15-25 year lifespan depending on coating weight and environment. GI sheets are manufactured by passing cold rolled or hot rolled steel through molten zinc bath at 450°C, creating a metallurgical bond. Unlike uncoated steel (MS/HR) that rusts within months outdoors, GI sheets maintain structural integrity and appearance for decades, making them the preferred choice for roofing, ducting, cladding, and outdoor applications."

    "content": "GI (Galvanized Iron) sheets have protective zinc coating that prevents rust, offering 15-25 year outdoor lifespan. MS (Mild Steel/HR) sheets have no coating and rust within 6-12 months when exposed to moisture. GI sheets cost 8-12% more than MS but eliminate maintenance, painting, and replacement costs. For outdoor applications (roofing, ducting, cladding, outdoor structures), GI is essential. For indoor structural work where moisture exposure is minimal, MS (HR) sheet is economical. The zinc coating on GI is self-healing - if scratched, surrounding zinc protects the exposed area through cathodic protection. MS/HR sheets rust immediately when scratched or damaged."

      "question": "What is regular spangle vs zero spangle?",
      "answer": "Regular spangle has visible zinc crystal pattern (flower-like appearance), economical, used for unpainted roofing. Zero spangle has smooth surface without crystals, better for painting, used as PPGI base. Regular spangle is standard for roofing; zero spangle costs ₹1,000-2,000 more per ton."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can GI sheets be painted?",
      "answer": "Yes, but surface preparation is critical. New GI sheets should be weathered for 6-12 months or treated with acid etch primer before painting to ensure adhesion.

    "title": "What is P&O Sheet? (Pickled & Oiled Sheet)",
    "content": "P&O sheet stands for Pickled and Oiled Sheet, also known as HRPO (Hot Rolled Pickled & Oiled). It is hot rolled steel that undergoes two additional processes: pickling (acid treatment to remove mill scale) and oiling (application of protective oil film). The pickling process uses hydrochloric or sulfuric acid to chemically remove the black mill scale from hot rolled steel, exposing clean gray steel surface. The oiling process applies a thin protective oil film to prevent rust during storage and transportation. P&O sheets offer better surface cleanliness and weldability than standard HR sheets, while being 15-20% cheaper than cold rolled sheets. They are ideal for applications requiring scale-free surface for welding, painting, or further processing, but where the tight tolerances of CR sheets are not necessary. Common in automotive structural parts, tube manufacturing, and precision fabrication where surface quality matters but cold rolling is cost-prohibitive."
